# 🐾 PetCare — National Pet Registry & Animal-Health Platform

A civic-tech backend that turns scattered pet ownership into **structured, geo-tagged public-health data** — so local government (municipality / VDC / ward / community) can *count*, *plan*, and *act*, while pet owners and vets get real value in return.

> **The big idea**
> Every pet is registered once, by its owner, with a location. Every vet is registered too. Before any treatment or prescription, a vet looks up the pet by its **public code**. That single loop produces a trustworthy, location-aware census that governments can use to plan **vaccination drives, subsidies, and health campaigns** — and that owners experience as **reminders, care tips, and a portable health record** for their animals.

REST API built on the **PERN** stack (PostgreSQL · Express · React · Node) with **Prisma ORM**.

---

## Why this exists

The platform serves three stakeholders at once:

### 1. Pet owners
- Register **one or many** pets — across **different species** (dog, cat, bird, cattle, goat, …).
- Each pet gets a unique **registration code** + optional microchip ID.
- A portable **medical & vaccination history** that any registered vet can read.
- Timely **reminders**: vaccine due dates, deworming, checkups, and seasonal **care tips**.

### 2. Veterinarians & clinics
- Vets **register** and are tied to a **clinic** with a real location (scalable: many vets per clinic).
- Before treating or prescribing medicine/food, the vet **asks for the pet's code** and pulls up its record.
- Every treatment, prescription, and vaccination is **logged against the pet** — building its lifelong history.

### 3. Government / municipality / ward
- Registration is the **civic mandate**: each pet is tied to an **administrative area** (province → district → municipality → ward) and a **latitude/longitude**.
- Officials see **pet counts per place** for accurate planning.
- Plan **subsidised vaccines** and campaigns from real vaccination-coverage data.
- Identify under-served wards and target outreach.

## Data model

The schema (in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](prisma/schema.prisma)) is organised around the three-sided loop above.

### Core entities

| Model                  | Purpose |
| ---------------------- | ------- |
| **User**               | One account for every actor. `role` ∈ `SUPER_ADMIN`, `ADMIN` (gov officer), `VET`, `PET_OWNER`. Carries a home `area` + lat/long. |
| **AdministrativeArea** | Self-referential hierarchy — `PROVINCE → DISTRICT → MUNICIPALITY → WARD`. The backbone of every "count per place" query. |
| **Pet**                | The heart of the registry. Unique **`code`** (what vets ask for), optional `microchipId`, `species`, geo-location, `areaId`, `isRegistered`, `isSterilized`. |
| **Clinic**             | A physical veterinary location with address + lat/long. Many vets per clinic → scalable. |
| **Vet**                | Vet profile (license, specialization, years) linked to a `User` and a `Clinic`. |
| **Vaccination**        | Per-pet vaccine events: `vaccineName`, `doseNumber`, `status`, `administeredAt`, **`nextDueAt`** (drives reminders + subsidy planning), `isSubsidized`. |
| **MedicalRecord**      | What a vet logs after verifying a pet by code: `diagnosis`, `treatment`, `medicine`, `diet`, `instructions`. |
| **Reminder**           | Owner-facing notifications: `VACCINE`, `CHECKUP`, `DEWORMING`, `CARE_TIP`, `GENERAL` over `PUSH` / `SMS` / `EMAIL`. |
| **Service**            | Catalogue of clinic services (checkup, vaccination, grooming…). |
| **Appointment**        | Bookings linking owner ↔ pet ↔ vet ↔ service, with status workflow. |

### How geography enables the census

Each `Pet` carries both a precise `latitude`/`longitude` **and** a link to a `WARD`-level `AdministrativeArea`. Because areas form a tree, a single ward count rolls up to municipality → district → province for free. Lat/long powers map visualisations and "nearest vet" lookups.

> **Scaling note:** location is stored as plain `Float` columns today (indexed by area). For heavy radius / nearest-neighbour queries, upgrade the columns to **PostGIS `geography`** + a GiST index — the model is already shaped for it.

Each module follows the same layering: **routes → controller → service → Prisma**, with **Zod validation** at the edge. Business rules and authorization live in the service layer.

## Getting started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit DATABASE_URL and the JWT secrets
```

`DATABASE_URL` format:

```
postgresql://<user>:<password>@localhost:5432/petcare?schema=public
```

> The credentials must match a real PostgreSQL role. If you hit
> `P1000 Authentication failed`, set the password to match your `.env`:
> `sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';"`

Create the database (once):

```bash
createdb petcare      # or: sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE petcare;"
```

### 3. Run migrations + seed

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate   # apply migrations + generate the Prisma client
npm run db:seed          # optional: load demo data (areas, clinic, users, pet, vaccine, reminder)
```

### 4. Start the server

```bash
npm run dev              # nodemon, http://localhost:8081
```

Health check: `GET http://localhost:8081/health`

---

## API docs (Swagger)

Once the app is running:

- **Swagger UI:** `http://localhost:8081/api/docs`
- **Raw OpenAPI spec:** `http://localhost:8081/api/docs.json`

Click **Authorize** and paste the `token` from a login/register response to try authenticated endpoints.

---

## Authentication

| Method & path                 | Description                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/register`  | Self sign-up (`PET_OWNER` / `VET`)            |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/login`     | Returns `{ token, refreshToken, user }`       |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`   | Exchange a refresh token for new tokens       |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`    | Revoke the refresh token (auth required)      |
| `GET  /api/v1/auth/me`        | Current user (auth required)                  |

Send the access token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on protected routes.

### Roles

`SUPER_ADMIN`, `ADMIN` (government/municipality officer), `VET`, `PET_OWNER`. Access is enforced by the `authenticate` + `authorize(...roles)` middleware and per-resource ownership checks in the service layer.

## Suggested next steps

1. **Pet code generator** — generate a collision-free, human-readable `code` (e.g. `NP-PET-XXXXX`) on pet creation.
2. **Vet lookup endpoint** — `GET /pets/lookup/:code` returning pet + vaccination + medical history (vets only).
3. **Reminder scheduler** — a cron job that reads `Vaccination.nextDueAt` and creates `Reminder` rows, then dispatches via SMS/push.
4. **Government dashboard endpoints** — aggregate counts grouped by `AdministrativeArea`.
5. **PostGIS upgrade** — for fast radius / nearest-vet search once data grows.
6. **Photo uploads** — wire `Pet.photoUrl` and `User` avatars to object storage.
